Java NIO - Path:-
==================
Path is the particular location of an entity such as file or directory in a file system so that
one can access it at that particular location


Path is interface which is used in Java NIO Package


Types of Path:-
---------------
1) Absolute Path
2) Relative Path

1) Absolute Path
----------------
Absolute path is the location address from the root to the entity where it locates.

2) Relative Path
----------------
Relative path is the location address which is relative to some other path.


To get instance of path we can use static method of java.nio.file.Paths class get() that 
convert a path String , or a sequence of String


Important Methods:-
--------------------
1. getFileName()  --> return the file system that created this object
2. getName()      --> Return the name element of this Path as a Path object
3. getNameCount() --> Return the number of name elements in the path
4. subpath()      --> Return the relative path that is subsequence of the name elements of 
		      this path
5. getRoot()      --> Return the root component of this path as a Path object , or null if this
	  	      path does not have a root component 
6. toAbsolutePath() -->Return the Path object that represent the absolute path
7. toFile() -->      Return a file object representing this path
8. compareTo() -->  Compare two abstract paths lexicographically . This method return zero if 
		    the argument is equal to this path , a value less than zero if this path 
		    lexicographically less than argument , or a value greater than zero if this
		    path is lexicographically greater than the argument

Java NIO - Selector:-
====================
Java NIO Selector is a multiplexer of selectable channels , which is used as a special type of
channel that can be put into non-blocking mode . It can examine one or more NIO Channels and
determine which channel os ready for communication i.e reading or writting

Use of Selector:-
-----------------
The selector is used for handling the multiple channels using a single thread , therefore it 
need less thread to handle the channels . Switching between the threads is expensive for OS . 
Therefore ro improve system efficiency  it is use
